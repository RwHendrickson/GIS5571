abstract = {Traffic emissions are a complex and variable cocktail of toxic chemicals. They are the major source of atmospheric pollution in the parts of cities where people live, commute and work. Reducing exposure requires information about the distribution and nature of emissions. Spatially and temporally detailed data are required, because both the rate of production and the composition of emissions vary significantly with time of day and with local changes in wind, traffic composition and flow. Increasing computer processing power means that models can accept highly detailed inputs of fleet, fuels and road networks. The state of the science models can simulate the behaviour and emissions of all the individual vehicles on a road network, with resolution of a second and tens of metres. The chemistry of the simulated emissions is also highly resolved, due to consideration of multiple engine processes, fuel evaporation and tyre wear. Good results can be achieved with both commercially available and open source models. The extent of a simulation is usually limited by processing capacity; the accuracy by the quality of traffic data. Recent studies have generated real time, detailed emissions data by using inputs from novel traffic sensing technologies and data from intelligent traffic systems (ITS). Increasingly, detailed pollution data is being combined with spatially resolved demographic or epidemiological data for targeted risk analyses.}

	This article explores air quality health impact assessments (HIAs) at different spatial resolutions. It's particularly interesting to read as someone outside of the medical field as it introduces new terminologies. The authors discuss many methods used to model air quality and epidemiological impacts at various scales. The critical discussion is how localized HIAs can be "informative and defensible," yet are prone to "biases and uncertainties." Prior knowledge of concentration-response (CR) functions is assumed and necessary to fully comprehend many of the sections.}

The latter half of the report is primarily maps and graphs complemented with discussion of the findings. There is a robust methods section that could be skipped over for people uninterested in the specificities of the sampling process. One notable point in the author's conclusion is their partnership with Virginia Tech to develop a land-use regression model (LUR) to understand spatial patterns of air quality in Minneapolis.}

	This paper discusses different methods and shortcomings in assessing racial and socio-economics as they relate to environmental hazards. The most popular method in these analyses has historically been the unit-hazard approach which defines a unit that hosts an environmental hazard (typically a zip code or county) and looks at demographics within that unit. This fails to acccount for the actual location of the site. The authors argue for distance-based models as an alternative and discuss methods to conduct this analysis. They then demonstrate that disparities are more pronounced when using distance-based models and insist that, as GIS technology advances, these methods will become easier to conduct. The paper is a bit of an artifact for modern GIS users because we are now very familiar with distance-based models. Still, it provokes one to reconsider statements made in earlier research and be critical of papers that do not adopt these types of analyses.

The paper concludes with general discussions of different geographies and spaces.

	This article discusses urban sustainability goals and their inclusion of environmental equity and justice (or lack thereof). The authors analyzed the 107 most populous US cities' and found a subset of 13 municipalities that used indicators to measure progress on environmental justice (EJ) issues within their sustainability plan. These 13 plans were further evaluated for their success in addressing EJ. A discussion follows which reverberates a few themes. Aggregated success is often used as a metric within these plans. This, however, does not necessarily benefit everyone equally. Ensuring distributional EJ requires intentionally designed and explicit indicators. The inclusion of historically disadvanaged communities in decision making must also be measured and improved. As a student interested in spatial justice, this paper introduces many important considerations and variables to include in my research.

	This book begins with the story of the Bus Riders Union decision of 1996 where it was determined that Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority had to prioritze inner city bus services and equitable access of public transit as amends for decades of discrimination. This was a first-of-its-kind decision that could have had a ripple effect across the country, but was ultimately blocked from extending to other cases by various court rulings. Still, the lessons and inspiration gleaned from this story are invaluable, and inner city communities in LA have seen noticeable improvements from this reinvestment. The auther goes on to introduce spatial justice which focuses on the geographic consequences of (in)justice. This book will introduce many new ethical considerations for a geographic information scientist as well as potential ocupational directions.

	The authors conducted a case study in a low to mid income neighborhood of Beijing, surveying residents' air pollution exposure and mobility. In 6 waves, 117 participants wore mobile air quality monitors for 48 hour periods. This was done in an effort to further understand the neighborhood effect averaging problem (NEAP). NEAP is a recent observation in environmental research where individuals that are highly mobile may experience different exposure than those that are less mobile in their neighborhood. This can alter statistical significance and extent of a measured neighborhood effect of a pollutant. Their methods and discussion are quite interesting. An good contemporary read for someone considering spatial environmental research.
